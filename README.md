## How to Build and Start the Project

### 1. Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Docker

- Docker Compose

- Git

- VSCode (recommended) with extensions for Python and Docker

### 2. Clone the Repository

Use the following commands to clone the repository and navigate into the project directory:

- `git clone` - git@github.com:dukemdiamond/coin-shroud.git

- `cd coinshroud`

### 3. Create a `.env` File

In the root directory of the project, create a `.env` file to store environment variables used by the application and
Docker containers.

You can create it using your text editor or with this terminal command:

- `touch .env`

Add environment variables like database credentials or secret keys inside this file as needed.
Do not commit the .env file to version control—it contains sensitive information.
